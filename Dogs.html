<p>Dogs are the most popular pet on the planet!</p>
<p>They evolved from a now-extinct species of wolf.</p>
<p>Dogs, Canis Lupus, are domesticated, four-legged mammals, known for their loyalty and companionship to humans,
 a relationship that has existed for thousands of years.
 Descended from wolves, dogs have a keen sense of smell and hearing, making them useful as service animals, police K9s, and even sniffer dogs.
 Dogs are social animals that form strong bonds with their families, providing unconditional love, companionship, and often serving as a family's security.
 They require proper care, training, and affection to thrive. </p>
